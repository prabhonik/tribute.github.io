            <div class=quo>A year since the pandemic took a toll on all our lives, we remember those fallen heroes who fought hard to win the war against the pandemic.</div>
            <div class="pubdate">31 August, 2021</div><hr>

            <p class="intro">
                Early in March 2020, people across the world were running their daily schedules and even planning international trips for the summer. School children were all set to finish their exams and dive into their summer vacation. Unfortunately, on this day last year, everything took a turn for the world’s population.
            </p>
            <p class="intro">
                The coronavirus had made its way to countries across the world. With the increasing number of positive cases and deaths, country leaders called for complete lockdowns in their respective nations. March 25th marks the day of the ‘Janata Curfew’ called by Prime Minister Narendra Modi across India.
            </p>

            <p class="intro">
                The virus that could spread by physical contact required the entire population to stay within four walls. Meanwhile, with so much uncertainty around what the disease could do, governments across the world tried to curb the fast-spreading disease by implementing social distancing and other hygienic practices in public spaces.
            </p>
            <p class="intro">
                In India, the situation turned quite dire. Once the lockdown was declared, many corporates laid off their employees. However, a huge population of migrant workers and daily wagers had nowhere to go with all transportation facilities shut down and no place of employment.
            </p>
            <p class="intro">
                With nothing stopping them, the masses began to travel back to their villages thousands of miles away by foot. Police officials were on their toes to curb this situation within the cities and at the outskirts risking their lives to keep the people safe.
            </p>
            <p class="intro">
                Meanwhile, another set of heroes worked tirelessly in hospitals as healthcare workers battled to control the spread of the virus. But in the fight against this virus, both sections suffered irreparable loss of life.
            </p>
            <p class="intro">
                Today, more than 2.75 million have lost the battle against this disease. On the anniversary of the lockdown, let us remember some of these fallen heroes, and we pay our respects to all those who’ve fought hard.
