                    <h3>A Doctor Who Dies Fighting on the COVID Frontline is a Martyr, Not Just Another Statistic:-</h3>
                    <p>
                        1076 as on May 19, 2021. This is the number of Indian doctors who have sacrificed their lives so far in the fight against COVID-19. This is not just a statistic; these are actual human lives lost and families torn apart. Just as a soldier who loses his life fighting comes home as a martyr, one would expect the same for these medical heroes. On the contrary, the supreme sacrifices made by our doctors are not even counted, let alone acknowledged.
